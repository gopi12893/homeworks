BREAK:
 loop stops the execution when break encounters and quits the loop.
 loop executes until the break encountersand then it terminates the execution.

CONTINUE:
  when "continue" encounters 
  it skips the current execution and moves forward for further execution.
  Here the loop executes untill last iteration.

BREAK in SWITCH CASE:
switch case starts executing the statements from where the condition matches,
it executes until break encounters. stops the iterations where the break encounters... usually switch case is writen for single statement execution therefore break is used after each statement. There is a default:break in the last of all the cases, it is used to execute the default statement if there is no case match and exit the switch iterations.
